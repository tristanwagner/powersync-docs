# PowerSync Documentation

Welcome to the PowerSync documentation repository! Our docs are powered by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/docs).

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone your repository:**
   - On GitHub, click "Fork" at the top right of this repository to create your own copy.
   - Then clone your fork:

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/powersync-docs.git
   cd powersync-docs
   ```
2. **Install Mintlify CLI:**
   ```
   npx mintlify install
   ```
3. **Start the local docs server:**
   - Run the following command at the root of the repo (where docs.json is):
   ```
   npx mintlify dev
   ```
   
   - If you see the error `✖ Must be run in a directory where a mint.json file exists.`, update Mintlify:

## Editing guidelines

### Navigation & Global Settings

- Navigation and other global settings are defined in `docs.json`. Learn more in [Mintlify's docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/global).
- If you move or rename a page, add a redirect using the `redirects` property to ensure existing links continue to work.

### Checking for Broken Links

Regularly check for broken links by running:
```
npx mintlify broken-links
```

### Whitelisting & Blacklisting Terms (Vale)

To whitelist terms so Mintlify's Vale integration does not flag them as misspelled:
- Add terms (one per line, case-insensitive) to `.github/vale/config/vocabularies/PowerSync/accept.txt`.
- To blacklist terms, create a `reject.txt` file in the same folder.
- For more info, see [Mintlify's docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/ci#vale) and [Vale's docs](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/vocab).
